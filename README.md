# Bet Probability Calculator
Tool to calculate probabilities in bets

It generates an excel file with more detailed probabilities

Known bugs:
 - The excel file generator can override a file if at least one is deleted. (I really should fix this but I'm lazy)
 - If you have an excel file opened and the generator wants to create one in the same directory and with the same filename, it won't generate the file
 - If you are faster than your own computer, is possible that the file displayed at the console is a day after the one actually generated
